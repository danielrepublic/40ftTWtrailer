# Domain Docs

Single-context repo: one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in

If these files don't exist, proceed silently. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-xxx.md
│   └── 0002-xxx.md
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding.
